"""
Script that allows for feedback to be reviewed.
Feedback are collected by retrieving all units and then getting the agent of each unit.
The agent state has the feedback data.

When running the script you first have the option of
filtering out potential toxic feedback.
After that you have the ability to view reviewed or unreviewed feedback.

If you select reviewed feedback, then the script will print out all of the reviewed feedback.
If you select unreviewed feedback, then the script will print out each
unreviewed feedback and give you the option to mark the feedback as reviewed.
