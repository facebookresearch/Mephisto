This folder contains the abstractions for Architects and Blueprints. There are three main subfolders:

- `architects`: this folder specifically has implementations of the `Architect` abstraction.
- `blueprints`: This folder has implementations of the `Blueprint` abstraction, as well as all related helper classes.
- `channels`: This folder contains implementations of the `Channel` abstraction, which is required by an `Architect` to communicate with mephisto.
