    - Reference the docs for the **[`mephisto-task` helper package](../packages/mephisto-task/README.md)** for interfacing with the Mephisto server.
    - You may also want to use components offered in the **[`annotation-toolkit` component library](../packages/annotation-toolkit/README.md)** to get up-and-running quick. The components of the library can be **[demoed in the storybook](https://annotation-toolkit-storybook.vercel.app/)**.
