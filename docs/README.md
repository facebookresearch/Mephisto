# Mephisto Docs

- Looking to get set-up and running quickly with Mephisto? Check out the **[10 minute quickstart](https://mephisto.ai/docs/guides/quickstart)**.

- Want to learn more about the different concepts within Mephisto and how they work together? The excellent and thorough **[architecture overview](https://mephisto.ai/docs/explanations/architecture_overview)** should serve as a great deep-dive and reference for beginners and advanced users alike.

### Customization

- Are you interested in a simple task with barebones HTML files? Reference the **[simple static task](/examples/static_static_task/)**.

- Are you interested in building a rich frontend? Learn about how you can create a **[simple React task](/examples/static_react_task/)**.
    - Reference the docs for the **[`mephisto-task` helper package](/packages/mephisto-task/README.md)** for interfacing with the Mephisto server.
    - You may also want to use components offered in the **[`annotation-toolkit` component library](/packages/annotation-toolkit/README.md)** to get up-and-running quick. The components of the library can be **[demoed in the storybook](https://annotation-toolkit-storybook.vercel.app/)**.

- Are you interested in dialogue-based tasks using the ParlAI framework? You may want to check out the **[example ParlAI demo task](/examples/parlai_chat_task_demo/)**. For UI customizations, we heavily use the **[`bootstrap-chat` helper package](/packages/bootstrap-chat/)**, so you may want to reference the documentation for that as well.
