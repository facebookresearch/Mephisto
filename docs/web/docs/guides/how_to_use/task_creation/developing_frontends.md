## The `mephisto-task` package

We provide the `mephisto-task` package for use in your front-end React tasks.

To install, add it to your npm project as such:

```
npm install mephisto-task
```

The `mephisto-task` project surfaces three React hooks depending on your use case:

1. `useMephistoTask` - Used for static tasks where one-time initial data is enough to power the task. See the example task in `/examples/static_react_task/` for an example project using this hook.
2. `useMephistoLiveTask` - Used for multi-turn, socket-based tasks, such as a dialogue task. See the example task in `/examples/parlai_chat_task_demo/` for an example project using this hook.
3. `useMephistoRemoteProcedureTask` - Used for static tasks that require access to some remote function on the back-end, for example invoking a back-end model for model-assisted annotation. See the example task in `/examples/remote_procedure/mnist/` for an example project using this hook.

Complete documentation for each of the hooks can be found in the [associated README for the `mephisto-task` package](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto/tree/main/packages/mephisto-task).

## Reusable UI component libraries

#### `@annotated` [BETA]

To make common annotation tasks easier, we provide the `@annotated/*` suite of packages.

These suite of packages were formerly published under the `annotation-toolkit` and have now been broken down into their own individual packages. We provide helper UI components such as `@annotated/bbox`, `@annotated/video-player`, etc.

 We welcome contributions to these packages. To create your own package, you can clone the template folder at `packages/annotated/__template__`.

#### `bootstrap-chat`

For chat-based components, we provide custom UI components in the `bootstrap-chat` package. You can find further information for them in the [associated README for the `bootstrap-chat` package](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto/tree/main/packages/bootstrap-chat).


## Adding UI error handling to tasks

Currently, we have beta functionality for error handling. We provide a few ways of getting a signal into how your tasks are faring:

1. Auto-logging errors for React-based tasks
2. Proactively alerting crowd workers when an error occurs and encouraging them to contact you if this happens
3. Exposing error logging infrastructure for more advanced custom front-end use cases

### Automatic frontend logging
For #1 above, auto-logging can be enabled for React apps by importing the `<ErrorBoundary />` component and wiring it up as such:

```jsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "mephisto-task";
...
const { handleFatalError, /* ... */ } = useMephistoTask();
...
return (
  <ErrorBoundary handleError={handleFatalError}>
    <MyApp />
  </ErrorBoundary>
);
```
This will automatically send an error packet to the backend Mephisto server when an error occurs.

### Alerting crowd-workers of issues
To opt into #2 above, you need to define a global variable as such:
```js
window._MEPHISTO_CONFIG_ = {
    /* required: */
    ADD_ERROR_HANDLING: true,
    /* optional: */
    ERROR_REPORT_TO_EMAIL: "example@example.org"
}
```

This will show a prompt as such if an uncaught error is detected:

![](/faq_ui_error_message.png)

### Advanced Usage
`handleFatalError` can also be used in any custom logic code you wish - for example, in handling errors for AJAX requests which live outside of the scope of React Error Boundaries:

```jsx
fetch("example.org/api/endpoint")
    .catch(err => handleFatalError(err.toString()));
```
