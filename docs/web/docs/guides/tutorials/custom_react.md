# Working on a custom task

Now that you've [launched a task or two](first_task), it's time to get into building your own. This tutorial focuses on giving you the tools to collect the specific data you're looking for by building a task of your own. This tutorial itself won't produce a useful task, but it should be useful for understanding how to go about creating a real one. You don't _need_ any React experience to get through this guide, though it will be helpful for understanding the usage more deeply.

## 1. Getting started
### 1.1 Making a new workspace
We'll extend from the static react task example, but we'll want to move it to it's own workspace. From within the main Mephisto directory:
```bash
cp -r examples/static_react_task/ tmp/static_tutorial/
cd tmp/static_tutorial/
```

Now that we're here, we should also set up your config file
```yaml
# hydra_configs/conf/example.yaml 
#@package _global_
defaults:
  - /mephisto/blueprint: static_react_task
  - /mephisto/architect: local
  - /mephisto/provider: mock
mephisto:
  blueprint:
    task_source: ${task_dir}/webapp/build/bundle.js
    link_task_source: false
    extra_source_dir: ${task_dir}/webapp/src/static
    units_per_assignment: 1
  task:
    task_name: custom-react-tutorial   # Remember to set an appropriate task_name!
    task_title: "Rating a sentence as good or bad"
    task_description: "In this task, you'll be given a sentence. It is your job to rate it as either good or bad."
    task_reward: 0.05
    task_tags: "test,simple,button"
```

The only change we'll make is to the `task_name` (as you should on any new tasks!), but we will update the other fields as we go. It's important to note the `task_source` and `extra_source_dir` arguments though, as this is where the `StaticReactBlueprint` class will be looking for the compiled React app's Javascript bundle as well as a folder for extra static resources for the page, respectively.

### 1.2 Launching the task
From the current directory, you should be able to execute the run script and get a job working. We're using a different `task_name` to prevent polluting our later task with data that won't share the same format. It is a good practice to do this with initial iterations, and to change the `task_name` any time you change input or output arguments.
```bash
python run_task.py mephisto.task.task_name=custom-react-tutorial-iterating
```
This will launch a simple task where an annotator is supposed to note a sentence as being good or bad. Clicking a button auto-submits the task. In the next sections we'll add other content. 

Moving forward, we'll update this task so that workers are able to edit the text as well as rate the original sentence.

## 2. Providing new data to the task
### 2.1 The `SharedTaskState` object and `static_task_data` attribute
We'll begin by modifying the `SharedStaticTaskState`'s `static_task_data` attribute. For info on this attribute, recall `mephisto wut`:
```bash 
$ mephisto wut blueprint=static_react_task static_task_data

                Tasks launched from static blueprints need
                a prebuilt javascript bundle containing the task. We suggest building
                with our provided useMephistoTask hook.
            

Additional SharedTaskState args from SharedStaticTaskState, which may be configured in your run script
dest              type                      default    help                                     choices    required
----------------  ------------------------  ---------  ---------------------------------------  ---------  ----------
static_task_data  Iterable[Dict[str, Any]]  []         List or generator that returns dicts of  None       False
                                                       task data. Generators can be used for
                                                       tasks with lengths that aren't known at
                                                       the start of a run, or are otherwise
                                                       determined during the run.
```
This field replaces using the `csv_file` used in the previous tutorial, allowing our run script to specify data directly. React tasks can be run off of `.csv` files as well, if you'd prefer.

At the moment, the data we're providing is as follows:
```python
shared_state = SharedStaticTaskState(
    static_task_data=[
        {"text": "This text is good text!"},
        {"text": "This text is bad text!"},
    ],
    ...
)
```
This corresponds to two `Assignment`s, each with an entry for `text`. Altering these will change the text that is present, while adding new entries to the array will lead to Mephisto generating more `Assignment`s. 

### 2.2 Editing `static_task_data`

For now let's just edit the data and add a new field. Update the `static_task_data` to look like this:
```python
static_task_data=[
    {"text": "This text is good text! Now it is extra good", "edited_by_requester": True},
    {"text": "This text is bad text!", "edited_by_requester": False},
],
```

At this point you can run the task again.
```bash
python run_task.py mephisto.task.task_name=custom-react-tutorial-iterating
```
Note the first one you work on displays your new edited text. But what about the new `edited_by_requester` field?

> **Tip:** In your own tasks, you can use a function that creates static task data, or even a generator for it, but this is discussed more in the [workflows](workflows) tutorial.

## 3. Accessing the new data
### 3.1 Using React Dev Tools
Generally, developing with React is easiest if you have the React Dev Tools extension in your browser. It's currently available in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/). With this you can peer into the react state and see what's inside:
![](/react_dev_tools_see_props.png)
Here on the right you can see the `text` and `edited_by_requester` fields accessible in `taskData`. Now that we know it's there, we can do something with it.

### 3.2 A prop-flow exercise for React newcomers
The source code for your frontend exists in the `webapp/src` directory. For those who are new to React let's take a stop at `MainApp` in `webapp/src/app.jsx` to follow the path of the props through the application:

```javascript
// webapp/src/app.jsx
function MainApp() {
  const {
    blockedReason,
    blockedExplanation,
    isPreview,
    isLoading,
    initialTaskData, // Task data comes from this hook
    handleSubmit,
    handleFatalError,
    isOnboarding,
  } = useMephistoTask();
```
Any Mephisto frontend task relies on either the `useMephistoTask` or `useMephistoLiveTask` hooks to get underlying state about the worker and the task. For now it's only important to note that we pull `initialTaskData` from Mephisto, as well as a `handleSubmit` function. (More details on usage of these hooks is available [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto/tree/main/packages/mephisto-task).)
```javascript
  if (blockedReason !== null) {
    return ...
  }
  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }
  if (isPreview) {
    return ...
  }
```
Mephisto tasks can have a few states, loading, blocked, preview, onboarding, and main task. At the moment we'll leave discussion of these states to later tutorials.
```jsx
  return (
    <div>
      <ErrorBoundary handleError={handleFatalError}>
        <BaseFrontend
          taskData={initialTaskData}  // We'll be using these two props
          onSubmit={handleSubmit}     // in the next sections.
          isOnboarding={isOnboarding}
          onError={handleFatalError}
        />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<MainApp />, document.getElementById("app"));
```
In this last segment, we find that we can access the `initialTaskData` from Mephisto in the `BaseFrontend`'s `taskData` prop, and will be able to call `handleSubmit` through `onSubmit`. 


### 3.3 Making a component to render the new data
Lets add a component to the frontend that will inform the worker if the `edited_by_requester` flag has been set. For this we'll be editing the `BaseFrontend` in `webapp/src/components/core_components.jsx`. Let's create a `TellTextIsEditedBlock` component:
```jsx
// webapp/src/components/core_components.jsx
function TellTextIsEdited({ taskData }) {
    if (taskData.edited_by_requester) {
        return <p><b>
            Note: this text was pre-screened by the requester
        </b></p>;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```
And now we can drop this into the `SimpleFrontend` component:
```jsx
// webapp/src/components/core_components.jsx
function SimpleFrontend({ taskData, isOnboarding, onSubmit, onError }) {
  if (!taskData) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }
  if (isOnboarding) {
    return <OnboardingComponent onSubmit={onSubmit} />;
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <Directions>
        Directions: Please rate the below sentence as good or bad.
      </Directions>
      <TellTextIsEdited taskData={taskData} />
      ...
```

Launching again we find that the first task has our new text, but the second task doesn't. Success!

![](/with_requester_screening_text.png)

### 3.4 Adding a component to respond with new data
Now that we've used the full flow of providing custom task data to the worker and having components use these, the next step is to allow submission of whatever data you would like. At the moment, all that is sent to the backend is the `rating`, as can be seen in the two `onSubmit` calls:
```jsx
onClick={() => onSubmit({ rating: "good" })}
...
onClick={() => onSubmit({ rating: "bad" })}
```
Based on how `onSubmit` is wired to Mephisto's `handleSubmit` function, anything (json-serializable) in the object passed to `onSubmit` will be what is saved for the task. For this tutorial we'll want to put something else useful into this object. To this end, let's add an input box that allows workers to submit an edit to correct the sentence in some way. 

We can add some state to `SimpleFrontend` with the [`useState` React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html). This provides us with an `editedText` value initialized to `taskData.text`, which we'll set to track the worker edits, and a setter to alter that value.
```jsx
// webapp/src/components/core_components.jsx
function SimpleFrontend({ taskData, isOnboarding, onSubmit, onError }) {
  const [editedText, setEditedText] = React.useState(taskData.text); // <=
  return (
      ...
```
We now need to create a text input field that is wired to this state:
```jsx
...
<p className="title is-3 is-spaced">{taskData.text}</p>
<div>
    <b>Corrections:</b>
    <input 
        type="text" 
        value={editedText} 
        onChange={(e) => setEditedText(e.target.value)} 
        size="50" 
    />
</div>
<div className="field is-grouped">
...
```
And lastly, make sure to add the new text to the submission packet in both `onSubmit` calls:
```jsx
onClick={() => onSubmit({ rating: "good", editedText: editedText })}
...
onClick={() => onSubmit({ rating: "bad", editedText: editedText })}
```

Let's launch one last time.
```
python run_task.py mephisto.task.task_name=custom-react-tutorial-iterating
```
And just like that we're able to see an input field:
![](/static_task_with_corrections_box.png)
When we hit submit, we can see our custom data is passed along as well:
![](/static_task_correction_submit.png)
Congrats! You've been able to collect some custom data through Mephisto. Of course, this is just scratching the surface on the types of tasks you can create.


## 4. Setting up a review
### 4.1 Examining the raw data

Now that we've finished creating the task, we'll want to be able to review the data inside. Let's start by creating an `examine_results.py` script:
```python
# examine_results.py
from mephisto.abstractions.databases.local_database import LocalMephistoDB
from mephisto.tools.examine_utils import run_examine_or_review, print_results
from mephisto.data_model.worker import Worker
from mephisto.data_model.unit import Unit

db = None

def format_data_for_printing(data):
    global db
    # Custom tasks can define methods for how to display their data in a relevant way
    worker_name = Worker.get(db, data["worker_id"]).worker_name
    contents = data["data"]
    duration = contents["times"]["task_end"] - contents["times"]["task_start"]
    metadata_string = (
        f"Worker: {worker_name}\nUnit: {data['unit_id']}\n"
        f"Duration: {int(duration)}\nStatus: {data['status']}\n"
    )

    inputs = contents["inputs"]
    inputs_string = f"Provided input: {inputs}\n"
    outputs = contents["outputs"]['final_data']
    output_string = f"Provided output: {outputs}\n"
    return f"-------------------\n{metadata_string}{inputs_string}{output_string}"


def main():
    global db
    db = LocalMephistoDB()
    run_examine_or_review(db, format_data_for_printing)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This review script is very much like the one we used in the first tutorial, however we've left things particularly generic for now. You'll recall that all of the tasks we'd launched so far used the same `task_name`: `custom-react-tutorial-iterating`. Let's see what happens when we check it out:
```
>> python examine_results.py 
Do you want to (r)eview, or (e)xamine data? Default examine. Can put e <end> or e <start> <end> to choose how many to view
e
Input task name: custom-react-tutorial-iterating
-------------------
Worker: x
Unit: 5984
Duration: 10
Status: completed
Provided input: {'text': 'This text is good text! Now it is extra good!', 'edited_by_requester': True}
Provided output: {'rating': 'good', 'editedText': "I've edited the text via the corrections box!"}

-------------------
Worker: x
Unit: 5982
Duration: 10
Status: completed
Provided input: {'text': 'This text is good text! Now it is extra good!', 'edited_by_requester': True}
Provided output: {'rating': 'good'}

-------------------
Worker: x
Unit: 5975
Duration: 11
Status: completed
Provided input: {'text': 'This text is bad text!', 'edited_by_requester': False}
Provided output: {'rating': 'bad'}

```
You may have a different number of submissions depending on how many you did in the tutorial, but importantly you'll find that not all of them have a provided output entry for `editedText`. This is because we changed the format mid-way while continuing to use the same `task_name`. 

Generally, you should change the `task_name` between runs such that your data format is consistent throughout, but you can also ensure that your `format_for_printing_data` function is tolerant of the changes.

In any case, for future runs you could have formatting that explicitly extracts the portions you're interested in, or does additional logic to make your review easier. For instance, you could make it so that the corrected text is only shown if the worker made an edit:
```python
...
outputs = contents["outputs"]['final_data']
did_edit_text = outputs['editedText'] == inputs['text']
edit_text_string = f"Corrected Text: {outputs['editedText']}\n" if did_edit_text else ""
output_string = f"Provided rating: {outputs['rating']}\n{edit_text_string}"
...
```

While creating review scripts is powerful, it's not always the easiest way to review data. Annotations that are best in full context, like videos for instance, would likely benefit from being able to view the data directly.

### 4.2 Using a web-based review flow

For tasks that are best reviewed through a full UI, Mephisto offers a way to create web-based review flows. 

To view the results of the task we just ran through the web-based workflow, run the `mephisto review` CLI tool:

```
mephisto review --db custom-react-tutorial-iterating --stdout --all
```

This will launch a local server where you will be able to browse, filter, and drill into the data collected for your task.

![](/custom_react_review_all.png)

You can also drill into a specific task to explore the details further.

![](/custom_react_review_single.png)

### 4.3 Customizing the web-based review flow

By default, we ship with a batteries-included review experience, however you can easily create your own interface with custom "renderers" for visualizing your collected data.

Let's walk through creating our own custom renderer for our data.

First, we'll create our review application by using the `create-react-app` npm package, with a mephisto review template. Continuing from within our project folder at `tmp/static_tutorial/` let's run:

```bash
npx create-react-app@latest custom-review --template mephisto-review 
```
Once the template is done installing we'll create a new file at `custom-review/src/custom/MyDataItem.js` and fill it in as such:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Card } from "@blueprintjs/core";

export default function MyDataItem({item}) {
    const rating = item.data.data.outputs.final_data.rating;
    const duration = Math.round(item.data.data.times.task_end - item.data.data.times.task_start);
    return <Card>
        <h1>{ rating === "good" ? "👍" : "👎"}</h1>
        <p>{duration} seconds</p>
    </Card>
}

```

Note that we're leveraging the `<Card />` component from the rich suite of components [provided by BlueprintJS](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#core/components/card) to create our renderer. By default, the review template imports the `@blueprintjs/core` library so you can immediately start using any of the UI components provided there.

Now that we've created our own ItemRenderer, we'll use it by updating `custom-review/src/index.js` to first import the renderer:

```jsx
import MyDataItem from "./custom/MyDataItem"
```

Then we'll pass it to the `<CollectionView />` component to modify the way in which our data renders in the grid view:

```jsx
<CollectionView
  collectionRenderer={GridCollection}
  itemRenderer={MyDataItem}
  pagination={true}
  resultsPerPage={9}
/>
```

To see our new renderer in action, let's build our app and invoke the mephisto review CLI with it.

```bash
cd custom-review/
npm run build
mephisto review build/ --db custom-react-tutorial-iterating --stdout --all
```

*Note:* Notice that the `mephisto review` command here is similar to the one run in the previous section, except this time we pass in the relative path to the build folder as an argument.

# Building from task blocks with `@annotated` [BETA]

Mephisto at the core is built for complete flexibility over the kinds of tasks you can create. Building everything from scratch though can be a lot, so we've created the annotation toolkit and `@annotated` suite of libraries. These have components that may be useful for your annotation tasks, as well as examples of developed flows you can use or extend for your tasks.

The full suite of tools is currently in beta and can be found in the [Storybook here](https://annotation-toolkit-storybook.vercel.app/).
