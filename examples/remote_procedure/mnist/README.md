# Mephisto MNIST Model Evaluator demo

This task is a simple model evaluation demo, presenting the worker with three spaces to draw images in, running an MNIST model on them to predict an output, and then allowing the worker to assess and correct that output.

Introduced in [#677](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto/pull/677), some screenshots and discussion there.

For more details how to write your own `webapp` (ReactJS application) see example in current directory. 
Also, read [short documentation](mephisto/review_app/README.md) 
for the main Review App to understand how to add review part in your `webapp`.
