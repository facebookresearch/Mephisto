# Contributing to Mephisto
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

### Core contributions

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
    * This can be done by running `pre-commit install`. This will check the if your code is formatted correctly on each commit.
    * Make sure that pre-commit is installed by following the steps in [this website](https://pre-commit.com/).
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Cypress Testing
For cypress testing the base url is: http://localhost:3000/?worker_id=x&assignment_id=1

### Running end to end tests on a task:
1. Run the task by running python run_task.py in the appropriate task folder
2. In a separate terminal window go into the webapp directory and run `npm run test`
3. This should open a cypress app
4. It is advised to test in Chrome(Chrome, Electron, and Firefox are all the options) as this browser works the best with Mephisto.
5. After clicking one of the spec files, the tests from that spec will automatically run

## Local Package Development
If you are modifying either the `mephisto-task` or `mephisto-worker-experience` packages you probably want to see your changes propagate to the task that you are working on.

The easiest way to do this is to run a task by doing:
```bash
python run_task.py mephisto.task.post_install_script=link_mephisto_task.sh mephisto.task.force_rebuild=true
```

Setting `mephisto.task.force_rebuild=true` runs `npm build` before running your task. By default the task is only rebuilt if a file is changed in the webapp, not if a linked package is changed.

Setting `mephisto.task.post_install_script=link_mephisto_task.sh` runs the `link_mephisto_task.sh` script after `npm install` is ran and before the task is started. This script should be located in the webapp folder of the task. While this script can do many things, for local package development the primary purpose of it is to link to a local package.

Alternatively, these values can be set in the task's hydra_configs/conf yaml file if you want to forgo typing the above and just type
```bash
python run_task.py
```
instead.

## Task Contributions
Generally we encourage people to provide their own blueprints as part of the repo in which they release their code, though if someone creates a strong case for an abstract `Blueprint` that is generally applicable we'd be happy to review it.
