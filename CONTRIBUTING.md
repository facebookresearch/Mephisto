# Contributing to Mephisto
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

### Core contributions

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

### Cypress Testing
To test a task:
1. Run the task by running python run_task.py in the appropriate folder
2. In a separate terminal window go into the webapp directory and run npm run test
3. This should open a cypress app where you can see if your tests pass/fail

### Task Contributions
Generally we encourage people to provide their own blueprints as part of the repo in which they release their code, though if someone creates a strong case for an abstract `Blueprint` that is generally applicable we'd be happy to review it.
