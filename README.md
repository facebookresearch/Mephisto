Mephisto makes crowdsourcing easier.

We provide a platform for launching, monitoring, and reviewing your crowdsourcing tasks. Tasks made on Mephisto can easily be open sourced as part of other projects. Like the [chess-playing automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephisto_(automaton)) we've adopted the name from, Mephisto hides the complexity of projects that need human interaction or input.

You can find complete details about the project on our [docs website](https://mephisto.ai).
