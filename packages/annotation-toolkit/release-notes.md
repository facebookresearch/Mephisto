### vNext
- Show helpful message when `<AppShell />` is missing a layers prop.
- Fix bug where duplicate actions were showing for selected alwaysOn layers.
- Add a 'â¬©' marker next to layers in the actions menu that are selected by virtue of selection, as opposed to the `alwaysOn` prop. Helpful for debugging and intuiting why certain actions are shown.
- Add a `hideName` boolean prop to prevent layers from showing up in the Layers Panel. Default: `false`.

### v1.0.5
- [See here for initial release notes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto/pull/427)
